				<h2>RELATIONALLY SOURCED, PURPOSEFULLY SHARED, SIMPLY ENJOYED</h2>
				<p>Relationships mean that the mutual benefit is more important than transactions. 
				When we say our coffees are relationally sourced, we are saying we care more about investing, 
				over time, in the people and communities producing those coffees over immediately satisfying 
				our bottom line. To us, the relationships matter and the people are worth it.</p>
				
				<h2>Specialty Pastries</h2>
				<p>
					Enjoy a selection of our fresh-baked, organic pastries, including 
					fresh-fruit muffins, scones, croissants, and cinammon rolls.
